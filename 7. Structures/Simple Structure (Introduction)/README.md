Structure provides us with ease of writing code. If we have to represent any real world entity in our program, we just have to make a structure using keyword "STRUCT" outside the main method, and then we can easily access it anywhere in our main program by making an object of that structure. In this folder, a simple structure program is made in which a Box structure is created. We can give the values of length, breadth and height. We can make as many objects as we want, it will help us in measuring volume of multiple boxes depending on the objects.
